    <h2>Scenario 1: Grayhole Attack<span class="toggle-icon"></span></h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        In a grayhole attack scenario, a malicious node selectively drops or modifies the packets it receives, causing disruption to the communication within the network. This attack aims to degrade the overall performance by targeting specific packets, such as those containing critical control information or routing updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grayhole attacks can be mitigated by implementing secure packet forwarding mechanisms, such as cryptographic authentication and trust-based routing protocols. These measures ensure that only trusted nodes are responsible for forwarding packets, reducing the impact of malicious nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, anomaly detection techniques and intrusion detection systems can be utilized to identify and isolate nodes exhibiting abnormal behavior, providing an added layer of defense against grayhole attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common countermeasures for grayhole attacks include secure multipath routing, where multiple paths are used to transmit data and ensure redundancy, and reputation-based systems, which assign trust levels to nodes based on their past behavior.

    <h2>Scenario 2: Wormhole Attack<span class="toggle-icon"></span></h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        A wormhole attack involves malicious nodes creating a virtual tunnel between two distant points in the network. This allows the attackers to bypass normal routing mechanisms and significantly reduce communication delays. The wormhole tunnel can be established by relaying packets through a high-speed link, giving the impression of a short, direct path.
      </p>
      <p>
        To mitigate wormhole attacks, techniques such as secure neighbor verification, packet time-stamping, and localization-based routing protocols can be employed. These measures help detect and avoid the presence of wormholes by validating the legitimacy of neighboring nodes, analyzing packet arrival times, and considering location information in routing decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the use of directional antennas and secure route establishment protocols can enhance the resilience of the network against wormhole attacks, as they make it more difficult for attackers to create covert tunnels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced defense mechanisms for wormhole attacks include intrusion detection systems that monitor the timing and sequence of packets, as well as cryptographic protocols that ensure secure communication between nodes.

    <h2>Scenario 3: Blackhole Attack<span class="toggle-icon"></span></h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        In a blackhole attack, a malicious node advertises itself as having the shortest path to a particular destination. As a result, all traffic is redirected to the attacker, who selectively drops the received packets, causing disruption in the network. This attack aims to disrupt communication between specific nodes or to hinder the overall network connectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countermeasures for blackhole attacks involve employing secure routing protocols that validate route advertisements and incorporate mechanisms for detecting and isolating malicious nodes. Techniques such as route verification, reputation-based systems, and source routing can enhance the resilience of the network against blackhole attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, anomaly detection algorithms and trust-based routing mechanisms can be utilized to identify and mitigate the impact of blackhole nodes in the network. These techniques allow nodes to make informed decisions about the trustworthiness of neighboring nodes and dynamically adjust routing paths accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced defense strategies against blackhole attacks include the use of intrusion detection systems that monitor packet behavior and detect abnormal patterns. Secure key management and encryption mechanisms can also be implemented to protect against unauthorized access and tampering of network communication.
