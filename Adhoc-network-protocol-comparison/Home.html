    Welcome to the Wireless Ad Hoc Network Performance Comparison website!
    This project aims to evaluate the performance of Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocols under security attacks in wireless ad hoc networks. 
    Wireless ad hoc networks have gained significant popularity in various applications, including military operations, disaster management, healthcare, and remote sensing, among others.
    These networks provide flexibility and rapid deployment in scenarios where traditional infrastructure-based networks may not be available or reliable.
    However, the decentralized and dynamic nature of wireless ad hoc networks exposes them to security threats such as jamming, eavesdropping, and denial-of-service attacks. 
    Addressing these security concerns is crucial to ensure the reliable and secure operation of wireless ad hoc networks. The evaluation and selection of appropriate routing protocols play a vital role in mitigating security risks and enabling efficient communication.
    By assessing the performance of AODV, DSR, and OLSR routing protocols under different security attack scenarios, this project aims to provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
    The findings will assist network engineers, researchers, and professionals in making informed decisions regarding protocol selection and contribute to the design and implementation of more secure and resilient wireless ad hoc networks.
