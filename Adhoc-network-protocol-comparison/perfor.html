  <section id="throughput" class="collapsible">
    <h2>A. Throughput<span class="toggle-icon"></span></h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Throughput measures the rate at which data can be transmitted over a network.<br>
        It represents the amount of data that can be successfully delivered from the source to the destination per unit of time.<br>
        Throughput is typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps). A higher throughput indicates better network performance,
         as it indicates a network's capacity to handle a larger volume of data.</p>

  <section id="packet-delivery-ratio" class="collapsible">
    <h2>B. Packet Delivery Ratio<span class="toggle-icon"></span></h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) is the ratio of the number of data packets successfully delivered to the destination nodes to the total number of data packets sent by the source nodes. <br>
        It represents the effectiveness of data delivery in the network.<br> A higher PDR indicates better performance, as it implies a higher percentage of successfully delivered packets.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="end-to-end-delay" class="collapsible">
    <h2>C. End to End Delay<span class="toggle-icon"></span></h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>End-to-End Delay is the average time interval between the generation of packets in a source node and their successful delivery to the destination node. <br>
        It measures the time it takes for a packet to traverse the network from the source to the destination.<br>
        A lower end-to-end delay indicates better performance, as it reflects faster data transmission and reduced latency.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="packets-dropped" class="collapsible">
    <h2>D. Number of Packets Dropped<span class="toggle-icon"></span></h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The Number of Packets Dropped refers to the count of data packets that are not successfully delivered to the destination during transmission.<br>
        Packet drops can occur due to various reasons, such as network congestion, errors, or limitations in the network infrastructure.
        <br> Minimizing the number of dropped packets is essential for maintaining high network performance and data integrity.</p>
    </div>

  <section id="jitter" class="collapsible">
    <h2>E. Jitter<span class="toggle-icon"></span></h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Jitter is a measure of the variation in packet delay between different nodes in the network. It quantifies the difference in arrival times of packets at the destination.
        <br>A higher jitter value indicates more significant variations in packet delay, which can lead to inconsistent and unpredictable network performance.
        <br>Minimizing jitter is crucial for achieving stable and reliable data transmission.</p>
